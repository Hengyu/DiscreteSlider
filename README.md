- SwiftUI
- iOS 14.0+, macCatalyst 14.0+, macOS 11.0+

## Installation

**DiscreteSlider** could be installed via [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). Open Xcode and go to **File** -> **Add Packages...**, search `https://github.com/hengyu/DiscreteSlider.git`, and add the package as one of your project's dependency.

## Usage

**DiscreteSlider** is highly customizable, you could use it with it's default appearance or create your own.

### Quick start

To create a slider simply instantiate `DiscreteSlider` class:

```swift
DiscreteSlider(
    options: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100], // Options that is used as a data source for the slider.
    selectedItem: $mySelectedItem   // Binding to the property that will store the selected item.
)
```

This action will create a slider with default appearance.

### Customization

Customization of a slider is not a big deal. **DiscreteSlider** provides three protocols that is used to represent the components of a slider: `SliderTrack`, `SliderTick`, `SliderHandle` and `SliderLabel`. By implementing each of the protocol you will be able to build your custom slider.
